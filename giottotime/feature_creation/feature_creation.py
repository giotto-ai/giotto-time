class FeatureCreation:
    """Class responsible for the generation of the feature_creation, starting from a
    list of TimeSeriesFeature.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time_series_features : List[TimeSeriesFeature], required
        The list of ``TimeSeriesFeature`` from which to compute the feature_creation.

    horizon : int, optional, default: ``5``
        It represents how much into the future is necessary to predict. This corresponds
        to the number of shifts that are going to be performed on y.
